# Super Simple Objects - Box & Pointers Assessment

## Overview:
- This assessment appeared on the written part of Exam 1 in the 202220 quarter
- It requires you to hand trace three operations and to draw the corresponding resulting box & pointers diagrams 
for each of the local variables declared in the operations

## To do:

1. Hand trace operation Q2Part1 found in DriverMain.java
2. Hand trace operation Q2Part2 found in DriverMain.java
3. Hand trace operation Q2Part3 found in DriverMain.java
4. Verify the correctness of your 3 diagrams against E1BoxPtrsPart1.png, E1BoxPtrsPart2.png, and E1BoxPtrsPart3.png
5. Run the app to see the output which can also be used to evalauate the correctness of your diagrams

## Note:
- Your diagrams must match those found in the solution .png files, mark for mark
- If they do not match, then it is likely you have a misunderstanding of how to do these diagrams
- Evaluate your diagrams at a fine-grain detail and determine why your diagrams do not match. If you cannot determine why, then seek help from your instructor. Do this before you take Exam 1
