# Singly Linked List

## Overview:
- This exercise provides you with the opportunity to implement and use a singly linked list
- There are two parts:
<br> -- *sll* package contains 7 unimplemented operations. These must be done first, this is where you will implement your singly linked list
<br> -- *sslAlgorithms* package contains 7 unimplemented operations. These must be done second. It depends on the *sll* package. 
<br>    These algorithms will give you practice at being a client programmer of the singly linked list


- There is no documentation requirement for this assignment
- This is an individual exercise/assignment

# Rubric

- Each of the 14 operations (7 in *sll* + 7 in *sslAlgorithms*) is worth 1 Pass/No-Pass for this assignment
- For an operation's implementation to Pass, *all* of that operation's JUnit tests must pass
- To earn a Pass for *sll*: Any 6 of the 7 JUnit tests for *sll* operations must Pass
- To earn a Pass for *sslAlgorithms*: Any 5 of the 7 JUnit tests for *sslAlgorithms* operations must Pass 

## To do:

1. In Eclipse, import this project (SinglyLinkedList) from your local copy of the CSSE220 repo
2. Implement the 7 operations in *SinglyLinkedList.java* found in the *sll* package
3. Run the included *RunAllTests.java* in the *sll* package to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests
3. Implement the 7 operations in *Algorithms.java* found in the *sllAlgorithms* package
3. Run the included *RunAllTests.java* in the *sllAlgorithms* package to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests
4. Upload your completed *SinglyLinkedList.java* and *Algorithms.java* files to this assignment's Moodle Dropbox

# Problem Description

- The operations in each package have documentation that describe the behavior of each operation
- This linked list implementation uses two fields called *first* and *last*. This facilitates navigation of the list
- *first* holds the reference to the first node in the linked list
- *last* holds the reference to the last node in the linked list
- If the list is empty, then the following must be true: *first* = <code>null</code> and *last* = <code>null</code>
- If a list contains a single item, then both *first* and *last* hold the reference to the node containing this item
- The first method you must complete is the *add* method found in *SinglyLinkedList.java*
