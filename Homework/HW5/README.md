# HW5: Intro To Unit Testing
- This exercise will let you practice creating unit tests for pre-existing code.
- This is an individual exercise. 

# Rubric
- To earn credit for this assignment, you must create a file called *TestThisClassTest.java*. 
- *TestThisClassTest.java* will have a JUnit test method for each method in *TestThisClass.java*. 
- Each method must have at least four different test cases (with in-line comments explaining why they are different). 
- Using in-line comments in the test cases, clearly identify which (if any) fail due to errors in the original code.   

# Instructions
- The specification of each of the problems is in the *TestThisClass.java*
code as Javadoc comments. Your goal is to write unit tests which can be run to  
check the methods' functionality.
- You SHOULD NOT correct the problems in *TestThisClass.java*; just create a new class called *TestThisClassTest.java* with JUnit tests and explanatory in-line comments. 
- Of the THREE methods, TWO contain errors. Your JUnit tests should expose these errors.
