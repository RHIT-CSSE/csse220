	 * During a heat wave, any sign of lower temperatures is news.  This function takes an

	 * drop.  If no city experienced a drop, the function should return null.
	 * 
	 * You can assume only 1 city will experience a drop.
	 * 
	 * Use maps to solve this problem.
	 * 
	 * Example 1:
	 * 
	 * Temps:    City:
	 * 80        Seattle
	 * 100       LA
	 * 81        Seattle

	 * Example 2:

	 * Temps:    City:
	 * 91        Terre Haute
	 * 92        Terre Haute
	 * 80        Seattle
	 * 93        Terre Haute
	 * 100       LA
	 * 83        Seattle
	 * 93        Terre Haute
	 * 82        Seattle
	 * 105       LA
	 * 85        Seattle
	 * 
	 * The function should return "Seattle" because 83 to 82 was a drop.
	 *
	 * Example 3:
	 * 
	 * Temps:    City:
	 * 91        Terre Haute
	 * 92        Terre Haute
	 * 80        Seattle
	 * 
	 * The function should return null because no city had a drop.
