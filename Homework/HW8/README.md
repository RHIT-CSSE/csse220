# HW8

## Overview:
- This assignment gives you practice writing recursive operations. 
- The *recursion* package contains unimplemented recursive operations. 
- Simply implement each of these operations using recursion (no loops!)
- This is an individual exercise/assignment

## Rubric:
To earn credit for this assignment: 
- all JUnit tests for each operation must succeed, AND 
- you must not use any loops. 

## To do:
1. Implement the methods in *HW8.java*
2. Run the included *RunAllTests.java* to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests
3. Upload your completed *HW8.java* file to the Gradescope dropbox

- There are no documenting/commenting requirements for this assignment, but feel free to add in-line comments to help you keep track of your base case(s) and recursive call(s). 

## Notes:
- You should NOT use ANY kind of loops (while, for, enhanced-for, etc.). Every problem must be solved using recursion. 
- If you use loops in your solution, you will not earn credit even if you pass all tests. 
- The specification of what to do for each method appears as a Javadoc comment above the method.
