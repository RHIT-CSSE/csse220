# HWTwelveProblems

## Overview:
- This exercise is intended to give you practice in Java with various algorithms learned in the previous course CSSE120 
- This is an individual exercise/assignment

## Rubric:

- All JUnit tests for each operation must succeed in order to earn a 100% for the assignment
- Your score for this assignment = (PercentageJUnitTestsPassed * TwelveProblemsTotalPoints)
- For example:
  - if PercentageJUnitTestsPassed = 80%
  - and if TwelveProblemsTotalPoints = 25
  - then Your Score = (.80 * 25) = 20 points


## To do:

1. In Eclipse, import this project (HWTwelveProblems) from your local copy of the CSSE220 repo
2. Implement the 12 operations in *TwelveProblems.java*. 
3. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests - do this by running *RunAllTests.java*
4. Upload your completed *TwelveProblems.java*.  file to the TwelveProblems Dropbox


- There are no documenting/commenting requirements for this assignment

## Notes:
- The specification of what to do for each of the problems appears as a comment just above the operation in the *TwelveProblems.java* file
- The included comments often have notes indicating what constructs are required to solve the problem
- To solve these problems, you will likely have to look up details in your textbook and/or instructional materials
- Not every operation that you are asked to implement has been discussed in class, in the instructional videos, or in the instructional materials
- The JUnit tests provided are not designed to be exhaustive - your code has to be correct for all inputs, even ones not specified in the unit tests
