# HW0

## Overview:

- The primary objective of this assignment is to get working smoothly the process of checking out homework projects Eclipse and submitting your .java files correctly to this assignment's Gradescope Dropbox
- This is an individual exercise/assignment

## Rubric:

- All JUnit tests for each operation must succeed in order to earn credit for the assignment

# To do:

1. Implement the two operations in *HW0.java*
2. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests - do this by running *RunAllTests.java*
3. Upload your completed *HW0.java* file to the HW0 Dropbox


- There are no documenting/commenting requirements for this assignment

## Notes:
- The specification of what to do for each of the problems appears as a comment (specifically, a JavaDoc comment) just above the operation in the *HW0.java* file.
