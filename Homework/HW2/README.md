# HW2: Java Strings and ArrayLists

## Overview:
- This exercise is intended to give you familiarity with using the Java API with practice using Java Strings and ArrayLists
- This is an individual exercise/assignment

## Rubric:

- All JUnit tests for each operation must succeed in order to earn credit for the assignment

## To do:

1. Implement the operations in *HW2.java*. 
2. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests; do this by running *RunAllTests.java*
3. Upload your completed *HW2.java* file to the Gradescope Dropbox for HW2. 

- There are no documenting/commenting requirements for this assignment

## Notes:
- The specification of what to do for each of the problems appears as a comment just above the operation in the *HW2.java* file
- The included comments often have notes indicating what constructs are required to solve the problem
- You may need to use the [Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/) for the [String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) and [ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) classes to know what methods you should or can use
- To solve these problems, you will likely have to look up details in your textbook and/or instructional materials
- Not every operation that you are asked to implement has been discussed in class, in the instructional videos, or in the instructional materials
- The JUnit tests provided are not designed to be exhaustive - your code has to be correct for all inputs, even ones not specified in the unit tests
