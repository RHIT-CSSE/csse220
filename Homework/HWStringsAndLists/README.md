# HWStringsAndLists

## Overview:
- This exercise is intended to give you familiarity with using the Java API with practice using Java Strings and ArrayLists
- This is an individual exercise/assignment

## Rubric:

- All JUnit tests for each operation must succeed in order to earn a 100% for the assignment
- Your score for this assignment = (PercentageJUnitTestsPassed * StringsAndListsTotalPoints)
- For example:
  - if PercentageJUnitTestsPassed = 80%
  - and if StringsAndListsTotalPoints = 25
  - then Your Score = (.80 * 25) = 20 points


## To do:

1. In Eclipse, import this project (HWStringsAndLists) from your local copy of the CSSE220 repo
2. Implement the 7 operations in *StringsAndLists.java*. 
3. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests - do this by running *RunAllTests.java*
4. Upload your completed *StringsAndLists.java*.  file to the StringsAndLists Dropbox


- There are no documenting/commenting requirements for this assignment

## Notes:
- The specification of what to do for each of the problems appears as a comment just above the operation in the *StringsAndLists.java* file
- The included comments often have notes indicating what constructs are required to solve the problem
- You will need to use the Java API for the String and ArrayList classes to know what methods you should or can use
- To solve these problems, you will likely have to look up details in your textbook and/or instructional materials
- Not every operation that you are asked to implement has been discussed in class, in the instructional videos, or in the instructional materials
- The JUnit tests provided are not designed to be exhaustive - your code has to be correct for all inputs, even ones not specified in the unit tests
