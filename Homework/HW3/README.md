# HW3

## Overview:
- This exercise will provide practice with the HashMap data structure, as well as more practice with arrays
- This is an individual exercise/assignment

## Rubric:

- All JUnit tests for each operation must succeed in order to earn credit for the assignment

## To do:

1. Implement the operations in *HW3.java*. 
2. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solutions pass all the unit tests; do this by running *RunAllTests.java*. 
3. Upload your completed *HW3.java* file to the Gradescope Dropbox for HW3. 

- There are no documenting/commenting requirements for this assignment

## Notes:
- The specification of what to do for each of the problems appears as a comment just above the operation in the *HW3.java* file
