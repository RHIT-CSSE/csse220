# Intro To Unit Testing

This exercise will let you practice creating unit tests for pre-existing code.
 
You will do this exercise by yourself.

# Rubric

Each problem is worth 5 points. 
(1pt each test case, +2 points for comments justifying and correctly 
identifying bad test cases. )

Total possible: 20 points.

The problems themselves are already reasonably documented --- don't
worry about writing Javadocs on this program but do keep your code
clean, well formatted, and understandable.

# Instructions

The specification of each of the problems is in the TestThisClass.java
code as comments. Your goal is to write unit tests which can be run to 
ensure the code works as desired (defined in the comments).

There are FOUR problems, TWO of which have an error.

You SHOULD NOT correct the problems in TestThisClass.java, but you
SHOULD create unit tests in a file called TestThisClassTest.java
which fail to pass when certain example code is run.

You must create at least THREE different examples (provide comments
justifying why they are different) for each method you are testing.
These test cases must be placed in a file called TestThisClassTest.java 
can be run by JUnit just like past examplesyou have used in class.
