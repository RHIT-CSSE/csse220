/**
 * This class represents a Person who can either be healthy (green), infected (orange), or recovered (pink).
 * Once a Person becomes infected, they will remain infected for a certain length of time before they
 * become recovered. Once recovered, the Person cannot be infected again.
 * 
 * Inspired by this article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/
 * 
 * To visualize a population of Persons over time you should provide a method that says if a Person 
 * isHealthy, isSick, or isRecovered.
 * 
 * 
 * This class should use inheritance to make it simple to write. You should not need to copy and paste
 * 
 * TODO: Part 4 You can change this file but will need to provide each of the methods started in order to get full 
 * functionality.
