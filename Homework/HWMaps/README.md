# HWMaps

## Overview:
- This exercise will provide practice with the HashMap data structure
- There are 5 operations to be implemented for this assignment - implementing all 5 is required
- This is an individual exercise/assignment <br>*Except* if you would like to collaborate with a partner on exactly 1 of the operations <br>If you work with a partner, then add a comment to the top of that operation indicating name of your partner


## Rubric:

- All JUnit tests for each operation must succeed in order to earn a 100% for the assignment
- Your score for this assignment = (PercentageJUnitTestsPassed * MapsHWTotalPoints)
- For example:
  - if PercentageJUnitTestsPassed = 80%
  - and if MapsHWTotalPoints = 25
  - then Your Score = (.80 * 25) = 20 points

## To do:

1. In Eclipse, import this project (HWMaps) from your local copy of the CSSE220 repo
2. Implement the 5 operations in *Maps.java*. 
3. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests - do this by running *RunAllTests.java*
4. Each student uploads her or his completed *Maps.java* file to the MapsHW Moodle Dropbox


- There are no documenting/commenting requirements for this assignment

## Notes:
- The specification of what to do for each of the problems appears as a comment just above the operation in the *Maps.java* file
- We highly recommend that you seek out a partner to collaborate on one of the operations. <br>Why? <br>Because you will be working on a multi-week project with at least 1 partner toward the end of this quarter. Now is a good time to find someone you can work with.
