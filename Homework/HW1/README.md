# HW1

## Overview:
- This homework is intended to give you practice in Java with various algorithms learned in the previous course, CSSE120.  
- This is an individual exercise/assignment. 

## Rubric:

- All JUnit tests for each operation must succeed in order to earn credit for the assignment

## To do:

1. Implement the operations in *HW1.java*. 
2. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests; do this by running *RunAllTests.java*
3. Upload your completed *HW1.java*.  file to the Gradescope Dropbox for HW1

- There are no documenting/commenting requirements for this assignment

## Notes:
- The specification of what to do for each of the problems appears as a comment just above the operation in the *HW1.java* file
- The included comments often have notes indicating what constructs are required to solve the problem
- To solve these problems, you will likely have to look up details in your textbook and/or instructional materials
- Not every operation that you are asked to implement has been discussed in class, in the instructional videos, or in the instructional materials
- The JUnit tests provided are not designed to be exhaustive - your code has to be correct for all inputs, even ones not specified in the unit tests
