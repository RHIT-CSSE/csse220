# HW1

- This assignment is mostly to get you set up with checking out homework projects and submitting them correctly
- You should find instructions on how to do both [in the Docs directory](https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse220/tree/master/Docs)
- Look for file *getting_the_repo.md* and the topic *How to Get Another Project From the Downloaded Repo* toward the bottom of that .md file

# To do

1. In Eclipse, import this project (HW1) from the CSSE220 repo that you cloned earlier
2. Implement the two operations in HW1.java
3. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests - do this by running RunAllTests.java
4. Upload your completed *HW1.java* file to the HW1 Moodle Dropbox
