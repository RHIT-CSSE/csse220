# HW1

## Overview:

- The primary objective of this assignment is to get working smoothly the process of checking out homework projects Eclipse and submitting your .java files correctly to this assignment's Moodle Dropbox
- Locate instructions on how to check out an Eclipse project from your local copy of the CSSE220 repo [in the Docs directory](https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse220/tree/master/Docs)
- Look for file *getting_the_repo.md* and the topic *How to Get Another Project From the Downloaded Repo* toward the bottom of that .md file
- This is an individual exercise/assignment

## Rubric:

- The 2 operations are worth 1 Pass/No-Pass for this assignment
- All JUnit tests for an operation must succeed in order to earn a Pass for that operation
- Minimum to Pass this assignment: 2 operations must Pass all their JUnit tests

# To do:

1. In Eclipse, import this project (HW1) from your local copy of the CSSE220 repo
2. Implement the two operations in *HW1.java*
3. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests - do this by running *RunAllTests.java*
4. Upload your completed *HW1.java* file to the HW1 Moodle Dropbox
