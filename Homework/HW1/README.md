# HW1

## Overview:

- The primary objective of this assignment is to get working smoothly the process of checking out homework projects Eclipse and submitting your .java files correctly to this assignment's Moodle Dropbox
- This is an individual exercise/assignment

## Rubric:

- All JUnit tests for each operation must succeed in order to earn a 100% for the assignment
- Your score for this assignment = (PercentageJUnitTestsPassed * HW1TotalPoints)
- For example:
  - if PercentageJUnitTestsPassed = 80%
  - and if HW1TotalPoints = 25
  - then Your Score = (.80 * 25) = 20 points

# To do:

1. In Eclipse, import this project (HW1) from your local copy of the CSSE220 repo
   - Read and follow the instructions in [importing_eclipse_project.md](https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse220/tree/master/Docs/importing_eclipse_project.md)
2. Implement the two operations in *HW1.java*
3. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests - do this by running *RunAllTests.java*
4. Upload your completed *HW1.java* file to the HW1 Dropbox


- There are no documenting/commenting requirements for this assignment

## Notes:
- The specification of what to do for each of the problems appears as a comment just above the operation in the *HW1.java* file
