# CSSE 220: Design Problem 3 - Spaceships
In a single player spaceship racing game, the mechanics surrounding ships are particularly important.  Each ship has its own current position, rotation, and velocity.  The game consists of a single player ship, controlled by the player, and several "enemy" ships controlled by AI.  Rotation and velocity can be increased or decreased to steer any ship. 
  - Ships controlled by AI are steered using a single AI strategy the depends on a *flying strategy*, that could be different for each enemy ship, which sets the rotation and velocity at regular intervals (say, every 10ms). 
  - The ship controlled by the player gets input from the playerâ€™s controller, which sets rotation and velocity. 

There are two commands to consider: 
  1. updatePlayerInput(inputData), which is called when a player presses a key on the controller 
  2. moveAllShips(), which first asks the enemy/AI ships to update their rotation and velocity and then updates the position of *all* ships in the game based on their current settings of rotation and velocity.
