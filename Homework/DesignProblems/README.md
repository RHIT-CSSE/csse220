# CSSE 220: Design Problems

This exercise provides opportunities to practice object oriented design.  You will
do this exercise by yourself.

# Example Problems

The [*Example Problems*](../../Docs/ExampleDesignProblems) includes a set of  design problems for you to practice on. Since these are practice problems, you can work them on your own or collaborate with other students.  

There are solutions with commentary and good designs provided. Use these to evaluate your proposed solutions.

# The HWs

The links for the 5 problems are provided below.

### Assignment Parts and Points
Details on the specific parts and point values are provided in GradeScope.

### Proposed Defective Solutions:
+ When identifying the principles that a defective solution has violated, it is vital
that you CLEARLY EXPLAIN why you believe that a principle is violated.
+ Within individual problems: To earn full credit, you must identify
that you identify what we would consider to be the single main problem in each flawed design.  You may list
several flaws (as a defective solution may contain a number of them), but there is usually one in particular that we are wanting you to identify.  This means you should look carefully and ensure your examination is exhaustive. If you miss the overall big issue but your argument overall is still reasonable, you will earn less than full credit.

### Your Solution:
+ In each problem, you are asked to give a design in the final part that functions properly and that does not violate the principles we have covered in class thus far.  For your response, your solution must address the issues you have identified and present a design that is "better" than the problematic solutions.  If your design is no better, or if it is somehow worse than the other proposed solutions, you will not earn full credit.

### Your Proposed Solution:
+ To earn full credit for this assignment, you must submit your solution which is a design that improves *AT LEAST* one of the two provided solutions by correctly fixing the identified violations
