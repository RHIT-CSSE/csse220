# CSSE 220: Design Problems

This exercise provides opportunities to practice object oriented design.  You will
do this exercise by yourself.

# Example Problems

The [*Example Problems*](../../Docs/ExampleDesignProblems) includes a set of four design problems for you to practice on. Since these are practice problems, you can work them on your own or collaborate with other students.  

There are solutions with commentary and good designs provided. Use these to evaluate your proposed solutions.

# The questions

These are available on the 220 Moodle site as Word documents, but can be downloaded here as PDFs as well.

+ [Part 1](DesignProblemsAssignment1.pdf)
+ [Part 2](DesignProblemsAssignment2.pdf)
+ [Part 3](DesignProblemsAssignment3.pdf)

# Turn-In Instructions 

You will complete these and submit to the corresponding 220 Moodle assignment.

# Grading (Pass/No-Pass)

+ There are two problems, each with 3 parts: The first two parts in each
  problem are
  labeled Solution A and Solution B.  Each of these proposed solutions
violate one or more of the design principles we have covered in the
lectures.  The third part is asking you to give a UML design for the
stated problem that correctly follows the OO Design Principles we have
covered. For all three parts, you are
only responsible for identifying and fixing the designs based on the
principles we have covered in class this far, you will not need to worry
about the other OO Design Principles until we cover them.

+ When identifying the principles that a solution has violated, it is vital
that you both LIST the principle that you believe to be
violated in the proposed design and that you EXPLAIN why you believe that
principle to be violated.
+ Within individual problems: To pass this assignment, we are asking
that you identify what we would consider to be the single main problem in each flawed design.  You may list
several flaws (as they may contain a number of them), but there is usually one in particular that we are
wanting you to identify.  This means you should look carefully and ensure your examination is exhaustive.  
If you miss the overall big issue but your argument overall is still reasonable, we will pass assignments on an individual
basis if your argument is reasonable and demonstrates that you have a grasp on the material.
+ In each problem, you are asked to give a design in the third part that functions properly and that does not violate the principles we have covered
thus far.  For your response, your solution should address the issues you have identified and present a design that is "better" than the
problematic solutions.  If your design is no better, or if it is somehow worse than the other proposed solutions, it will not be counted as correct.
+ A *No-Pass* is awarded if you miss all the main issues and identify things that were not problems, etc. 
+ To *Pass* this assignment, you must do the following:
  (1) For both Solution A and Solution B, you must make an attempt to identify the Principle violated and must also provide a good English explanation
  (2) Have correct *AT LEAST* 1 of the 2 answers provided for item #1
  (3) Submit a design that improves *AT LEAST* one of the two provided solutions by correctly fixing the identified violations
