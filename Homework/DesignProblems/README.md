# CSSE 220: Design Problems

This exercise will let you practice object oriented design.  You will
do this exercise by yourself.

# Example Problems

[Here are a set of four design problems for you to practice on your
own](../../Docs/ExampleDesignProblems).  In addition, there is a
solution with commentary and good designs to compare with the designs
you produce on your own.

# The questions

~Should be handed out in class but you can get them here:~

These are available on Moodle as Word files, but can be downloaded here as PDFs as well.

+ [Part 1](DesignProblemsAssignment1.pdf)
+ [Part 2](DesignProblemsAssignment2.pdf)
+ [Part 3](DesignProblemsAssignment3.pdf)

# Turn-In Instructions 

~You will turn in each packet at the beginning of the next class.~

You will complete these and submit via Moodle.

# Grading (pass/fail)

+ There are two problems, each with 3 parts: The first two parts in each
  problem are
  labeled Solution A and Solution B.  Each of these proposed solutions
violate one or more of the design principles we have covered in the
lectures.  The third part is asking you to give a UML design for the
stated problem that correctly follows the OO Design Principles we have
covered. For all three parts, you are
only responsible for identifying and fixing the designs based on the
principles we have covered in class this far, you will not need to worry
about the other OO Design Principles until we cover them.
+ When identifying the principles that a solution has violated, it is vital
that you both LIST the principle that you believe to be
violated in the proposed design and that you EXPLAIN why you believe that
principle to be violated.
+ Within individual problems: To pass this assignment, we are asking
that you identify what we would
  consider to be the single main problem in each flawed design.  You may list
  several flaws (as they may contain a number of them), but there is usually one in particular that we are
wanting you to identify.  This means you should look carefully and ensure your
  examination is exhaustive.  If you miss the overall big issue but your
argument overall is still reasonable, we will pass assignments on an individual
basis if your argument is reasonable and demonstrates that you have a
grasp on the material.
+ In the two separate problems, you are asked to give a design in the
  third part that
  functions properly and that does not violate the principles we have covered
thus far.  For your response, your solution should address the issues
you have identified and present a design that is "better" than the
problematic solutions.  If your design is no better, or if it is somehow worse
than the other proposed solutions, it will not be counted as correct.
+ To completely miss a problem 
  is to miss all the main issues and to list things that were not even
problems, etc. To pass this assignment, you may completely miss any 1 of the 6
  parts of the assignment (there are two problems, each with three
parts). The remaining 5 need to be reasonably correct responses when
compared to our answer key.
