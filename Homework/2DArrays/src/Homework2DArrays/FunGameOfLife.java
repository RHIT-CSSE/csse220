	 * Given a int[][] with the states of cells (all 1s or 0s) return a NEW int[][]
	 * with the state of all the cells in the next iteration of
	 * 
	 * Conway's Game of Life: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
	 * 
	 * The rules are remarkably simple:
	 * 
	 * 1. A cell is considered alive if it has a 1 and dead if it contains a 0 2.
	 * Live cells stay alive if they have 2 or 3 neighbors that are alive 3. Dead
	 * cells become alive if they have exactly 3 live neighbors.
	 * 
	 * Each cell has 8 neighbors (all cardinal directions and diagonals) The grid
	 * should WRAP around the edges (effectively a torus) so that every cell has 8
	 * neighbors and edges touch one another.
	 *

	 *   
	 *   0000              0000
	 *   0110    becomes   0110

	 *         Hint: You will want two different int[][] otherwise if you change one
	 *         cell then it impacts calculate for the next cells that are its
	 *         neighbors, they should all be changed based on the prior state.
	 *
