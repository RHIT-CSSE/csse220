The java development environment we will be using in 220 is Eclipse.
No particular version of java/eclipse is required, so if you've got
one installed it will probably work fine.  But if you don't, follow
the steps below.

NOTE: If you already have a version of Eclipse installed, you will likely want to uninstall it and install the latest version.  When you do this, you MUST make sure that you have Java 21 installed!

# Install Java

The thing you want to install is the *Java SE Development Kit 21* <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21-windows">Download it here</a>

1. Scroll until you see the different OS's listed
2. Select the download for your machine (e.g., *Windows x64 Installer*)

Then run the downloaded file and install it in the default location

# Install Eclipse

The thing you want to install is the *Eclipse IDE for Java Developers*:
<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Download it here</a>

Choose the download based on your platform: Windows, macOS, Linux

Then run the downloaded file and select *Eclipse IDE for Java Developers* and then default choices (if any are presented)

After that, just install eclipse following the defaults


# Run Eclipse and create a workspace

After the install, running Eclipse should be as simple as double clicking the Eclipse icon.

When Eclipse starts up, it should ask you where about an Eclipse *workspace* and where it should be located on your machine

You can pick anywhere you like, but:

1. Recommended, create a new workspace for CSSE220. For example, *CSSE220Fa21*
2. You'll need to navigate to this directory to submit assignments so
   you should know where it is
3. It can be good to put in a place that's synced to the cloud
   (e.g. Rose Hulman's OneDrive).  That way your code will be
   automatically backed up.

# Make a shortcut to Eclipse
- You will be starting up Eclipse hundreds of times (if not more) this quarter, save yourself some time by placing a short cut on your machine's task bar or startup menu
