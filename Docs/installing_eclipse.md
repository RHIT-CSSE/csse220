The java development environment we will be using in 220 is Eclipse.
No particular version of java/eclipse is required, so if you've got
one installed it will probably work fine.  But if you don't, follow
the steps below.

# Install Java

The thing you want to install is the "Java 8 SE Development Kit"

<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html#license-lightbox">Download it here</a>

Click the radio button that says "Accept License Agreement".  Then
select the "Windows x64 version".

Then run the downloaded file and install it in the default location.

# Install Eclipse

The thing you want to install is the *Eclipse IDE for Java Developers*:
<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Download it here</a>

Choose the download based on your platform: Windows, macOS, Linux

Then run the downloaded file select: Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
hich version you'd like to
install.<br>
Select  *Eclipse IDE for EE Developers* and then default choices (if any are presented)

After that, just install eclipse following the defaults.

# Run eclipse

After the install, running eclipse should be as simple as double clicking the eclipse icon.

When eclipse starts up, it should ask you where it's eclipse "workspace" should be.

You can pick anywhere you like, but:

1. Recommended, create a new workspace for CSSE220. For example, *CSSE220Fa21*
2. You'll need to navigate to this directory to submit assignments so
   you should know where it is
3. It can be good to put in a place that's synced to the cloud
   (e.g. Rose Hulman's OneDrive).  That way your code will be
   automatically backed up.
