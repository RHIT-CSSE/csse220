The java development environment we will be using in 220 is Eclipse.
No particular version of java/eclipse is required, so if you've got
one installed it will probably work fine.  But if you don't, follow
the steps below.

# Install Java

The thing you want to install is the "Java 8 SE Development Kit"

<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html#license-lightbox">Download it here</a>

Click the radio button that says "Accept License Agreement".  Then
select the "Windows x64 version".

Then run the downloaded file and install it in the default location.

# Install Eclipse

The thing you want to install is the Eclipse (Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers):
<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-06/r">Download it here</a>

There should be a "Download 64-bit" button for the latest version of
eclipse.

Then run the downloaded file it will ask which version you'd like to
install.  Select the Eclipse IDE for EE Developers.

After that, just install eclipse following the defaults.

# Run eclipse

After the install, running eclipse should be as simple as double clicking the eclipse icon.

When eclipse starts up, it should ask you where it's eclipse "workspace" should be.

You can pick anywhere you like, but:

1. If you've taken CSSE120 (or CSSE220 before), it should probably a
   new empty directory 'cause otherwise there will be a ton of
   projects that cause confusion.
2. You'll need to navigate to this directory to submit assignments so
   you should know where it is
3. It can be good to put in a place that's synced to the cloud
   (e.g. Rose Hulman's OneDrive).  That way your code will be
   automatically backed up.
