The Java integrated development environment (IDE) we will be using in 220 is IntelliJ.

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have a version of Java installed, you will likely want to uninstall it and install Java 21. 

# Install Java

1. Download the installer for Java SE Development Kit 21, a.k.a. JDK 21, from [this download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21).
  - Scroll until you see the different OS's listed and select your operating system (e.g., *Windows*)
  - Select the download for your machine (e.g., *Windows x64 Installer*)
2. Run the downloaded file and install it in the default location. 

# Install IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
IntelliJ IDEA is a popular and feature-rich Java IDE (and it is even written in Java!). We will use it to view, edit, and run Java source code. If you took CSSE120 at Rose-Hulman and used the PyCharm Python IDE, you may find IntelliJ familiar since both are made by JetBrains. 

1. From [the IntelliJ IDEA download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows), download the appropriate installer (e.g., *.exe (Windows)*) under IntelliJ IDEA ***Community Edition***. 
2. Run the downloaded file and install it with the default settings. 

# Make a shortcut to IntelliJ
You will be starting up IntelliJ hundreds of times (if not more) this quarter, so save yourself some time by pinning it to the taskbar, creating a desktop shortcut, etc.
