The Java integrated development environment (IDE) we will be using in 220 is IntelliJ.

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have a version of Java installed, you will likely want to uninstall it and install Java 21. 

# Install Java

1. Download the installer for Java SE Development Kit 21, a.k.a. JDK 21, from [this download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21).
  - Scroll until you see the different OS's listed and select your operating system (e.g., *Windows*)
  - Select the download for your machine (e.g., *Windows x64 Installer*)
2. Run the downloaded file and install it in the default location. 

# Install IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
IntelliJ IDEA is a popular and feature-rich Java IDE (and it is even written in Java!). We will use it to view, edit, and run Java source code. If you took CSSE120 at Rose-Hulman and used the PyCharm Python IDE, you may find IntelliJ familiar since both are made by JetBrains. 

1. From [the IntelliJ IDEA download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows), download the appropriate installer (e.g., *.exe (Windows)*) under IntelliJ IDEA ***Community Edition***. 
  - Make sure you scroll down and install the Community Edition, not the Ultimate Edition. 
2. Run the downloaded file and install it with the default settings. 

# Make a shortcut to IntelliJ
You will be starting up IntelliJ hundreds of times (if not more) this quarter, so save yourself some time by pinning it to the taskbar, creating a desktop shortcut, etc. 

# Disable Full-line Code Completion in IntelliJ Settings
IntelliJ has lots of advanced features designed to help professional software engineers. Unfortunately, some of these can get in the way of learning, such as [full-line code completion](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/full-line-code-completion.html). 

To disable this setting, open IntelliJ settings from the menu, then go to `Editor > General > Inline Completion`. Un-check the box next to "Enable local Full Line completion suggestions", then click Apply and OK. 

> [!NOTE]
> Using Full Line completion, or plugins with similar functionality, during timed assessments is considered academic dishonesty.
