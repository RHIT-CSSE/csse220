# Contact Info, Outside Help

## Instructors

Outside of normal class time, we the instructors are almost always
able to assist you when we are in our respective offices.

## Other sources of help

Don’t try to be the "Lone Ranger" in this course, especially if you do
not find the course easy. If you find that you have worked on
something for 20 minutes without making any progress, it’s probably
time to seek help! Software development is a team sport. The best
programmers know that a fresh set of eyes can often spot a problem
right away.

* The Learning Center is an excellent source of help for students who
  are taking CSSE 220 this term. The center has prepared a schedule of
  students who will serve as CSSE 220 assistants at different
  times. Be sure to visit the learning center whenever you need
  assistance and an instructor is not available.
* Sophomore residence (Percopo Hall) frequently has tutors available
  to help anyone with CSSE220
* The CSSE Labs often have student lab assistants who can help with
  220
* Besides the instructors, in-class assistants, and other resources
  noted above, other students in the course can often be a great
  source of help. And they will also learn more as they explain things
  to you. Just be sure they don't give you answers instead of help in
  their desire to please you.

# Optional Textbook

![Book Cover](misc/BigJava7.jpg)

This book is especially good for students who would like some help
with Java, as it introduces the language from scratch.  It also covers
the later topics of the course.  That said, it's completely optional
and just for folks who would like extra help.

# Late Assignment Policy

In general, you should plan ahead and submit assignments on time. This
course has no 'late day' policy and late assignments are generally
worth 0 points unless you have made special arrangements.

However we understand that situations can arise. We handle all
situations on a case-by-case basis. Here are some general guidelines:

* We expect to be notified as soon as is feasible. If you are very
  ill, we understand that that might be slightly after the assignment
  due date. For other situations, it's usually possible to notify us
  in advance.
* The usual extension we will provide is 24 hours. Occasionally we may
  allow 48 hours. More than that is very unlikely.
* We keep track of extensions per student and if you seem to be
  overusing the privilege we will stop allowing extensions.
* If the reason you are late is because you are having trouble
  completing the assignment (e.g. a bug you can't fix or just
  difficulty understanding) get help from an instructor. Don't assume
  that more time will fix the problem; plan to get help.

In classes quizzes cannot be made up. However, we will drop your 3 lowest quiz grades. 

# Grading

| Weight | Criteria                                                        |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5%     | In-class quizzes                                                |
| 30%    | Homework, programming problems and projects, in-class exercises |
| 10%    | Team project                                                    |
| 16%    | Exam 1                                                          |
| 16%    | Exam 2                                                          |
| 23%    | Final Exam                                                      |

Final grades are also contingent on the following:

* You must earn a C grade on at least one exam in order to earn a C in
  the course.
* You must have a passing average on the exams in order to pass the
  course. This average is computed including the higher weight of the
  final.
* You must demonstrate that you can individually write and debug
  simple Java programs at the level of this course in order to
  pass. The exams will be the usual way to do this. The instructor
  reserves the right to change final grades when the average in a
  major category (homework, exams, project) differs significantly from
  the overall average.
* Attendance is required, if you miss more than 3 classes over the
  course of the term you must contact us.
* Please note that CSSE 230 has as a prerequisite a grade of C or
  better in CSSE 220

## Letter Grades

The following table provides the TENTATIVE breakdown for each letter
grade. Note that to receive an “A” in this course, your final grade in
the course must be 93% or higher. Also note that below 65% is failing.
 
| Letter Grade | Final Average |
|--------------|---------------|
| A            | 93‐100%       |
| B+           | 88‐92%        |
| B            | 83‐87%        |
| C+           | 78‐82%        |
| C            | 73‐77%        |
| D+           | 68‐72%        |
| D            | 65‐67%        |
| F            | 0‐64%         |

#  We want you and the other students to feel welcomed in our classroom

 If at any point, you are not comfortable in the classroom, for ANY
 reason, or you observe any behaviors by ANYONE (classmates, course
 assistants or your instructors) that may make the classroom climate
 feel less welcoming for students: please tell us.

Ways to do so include:

* Ask to meet with your instructor privately. Or, explain your concern
  to your professor after class or by email if you feel comfortable
  with that and the issue does not require a conversation.
* Talk with any instructor in the department with whom you feel
  comfortable.
* If you don't know any professors well, you might start with
  Professor Amanda Stouder, who has agreed to be an ombudsman to help
  ensure that our classroom climates are welcoming to all. Her office
  is Moench F218, phone 877-8138, email stouder AT rose-hulman.edu Or
  Professor Shawn Bohner, who has also agreed to be an ombudsman to
  help ensure that our classroom climates are welcoming to all. His
  office is Moench F224, phone 877-8685, email bohner AT
  rose-hulman.edu.
* The department chair, Professor JP Mellor, is a good choice if you
  feel that your instructor is not addressing your concerns
  appropriately. His office is Moench F228, phone 877-8085, email
  mellor AT rose-hulman.edu.
* All your professors will do their utmost to ensure your
  confidentiality, but sometimes you might feel the need to say
  something anonymously. You can do so via the link on our class'
  Moodle page labeled Anonymous Feedback. All we ask is that you not
  use it just to vent when you are momentarily frustrated. Take a deep
  breath, count to 10, and if you still want to express a concern, by
  all means use the Anonymous Feedback tool in Moodle.
* Know your campus resources beyond the CSSE department as well. These
  include your faculty advisor, your RAs and SAs, and the Office of
  Student Affairs.
* Or, if you want to express concerns in a completely confidential
  way, [the Student Counseling
  Center](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/wellness-and-health-services/counseling-services/index.html)
  is an excellent resource.

You can do your part to ensure a welcoming, professional classroom climate by:

* Speak to your classmates, course assistants and instructors with
  courtesy and professionalism. The classroom atmosphere is informal,
  but avoid off-color jokes, rude language, suggestive images on your
  laptop or screen, or just about anything that might offend someone.
* Be supportive of your classmates. Offer help where appropriate. Help
  your classmates feel confident and welcomed.
* Project respect to classmates, course assistants and
  instructors. (And please tell us, as described above, if you feel
  anyone is being disrespectful of you or others in the classroom.)
* Avoid words and behaviors that might be perceived as confrontational
  or aggressive. Strive to avoid negative "you " phrases like "you are
  wrong " or "you need to ... ". Instead, use neutral "I/us " phrases
  like "I think that that approach is not right " or "Perhaps it would
  be helpful for us to ... "
* Whenever possible, arrive to class on time. (Your instructor may
  assign penalties for tardiness or absence
* Set your phone to a "silent " mode, turn off notifications on your
  computer that might distract classmates, and display only
  appropriately professional images on your computer screen.
* Don't do anything that will detract from your learning or that of
  people around you. Such things include talking loudly, chewing gum
  noisily, and not taking adequate care of your personal hygiene.
* Restrict all your conversations in class to things related to the
  class, except for times when your instructor allows you to do
  otherwise (as in a between-periods break, for example).
* If you need to check email or do non-class-related things during
  class, try to sit in the back row so that you minimize any
  disruption of classmates.
* If you are experiencing issues that may make you less able to be
  respectful to others in the classroom, consider alerting your
  instructor to that fact. Additionally, we strongly encourage any
  student who is feeling stress or experiencing any sort of difficult
  issue to contact the [Student Counseling
  Center](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/wellness-and-health-services/counseling-services/index.html). They
  are an excellent resource available to students for free.

# Academic Integrity

Recall the Institute policy on academic misconduct:

> Rose-Hulman expects its students to be responsible adults and to
> behave at all times with honor and integrity.

Exams and homework will be done on an individual basis except when
explicitly noted. The simple rule of thumb for individual work is:

Never give or use someone else’s code or written answers.

Such exchanges are definitely cheating and not cooperation. The
departmental statement on academic honesty has more detailed advice.

This policy INCLUDES sharing code after an exam has completed. Due to
the nature of our exams, you will have access to your code after the
exam time has completed. This means that if you share your code,
someone else may try to commit is as theirs. Understand we have access
to commit logs and can easily see when changes were made and who made
them. Also, you may be asked if you can share your code with a friend
after an exam so they can see how to do the problems. While this may
seem okay (as the exam is over) we have seen cases in which a student
will ask a friend to "see " their code, then commit it to their own
exam repository as their own. If this behavior is discovered, we will
be prosecuting both the person who committed the code AND the person
who shared the code. If a friend wants to see how you solved a problem
after an exam, wait at least until grades are submitted, or you are
risking an F on the exam and possibly the class. This policy will by
STRONGLY ENFORCED. The best thing to do in this case is to remind your
friend of this policy, then suggest they speak to a TA or the
professor so they can make sure they understand the code, which is
much more important than just obtaining a copy.

This policy INCLUDES sharing code after graduating from this
course. If your code is found used in some other students solution,
after your have already completed this course - you will receive a
retroactive F in this course.

We encourage you to discuss the problems and general approaches to
solving them with other students. However, when it comes to writing
code, it should be your own work (or the work of your group if it is a
group or partner assignment). If you are having trouble understanding
how some library code works or pinning down a run-time or logic error
in your program, by all means talk to someone about it.

If you use someone else’s ideas in your solution (or any other work
that you do anywhere), you have to:

* give credit to that person in the comment section of your program, and
* be sure that you understand it as well as if it were your own.

If you are ever in doubt about whether some specific situation
violates the policy, the best approach is to discuss it with your
instructor beforehand. This is a very serious matter that we do not
take lightly. Nor should you.

You should never look at another student’s solution to get ideas of
how to write your own code. Beginning the process of producing your
own solution with an electronic copy of work done by other students is
never appropriate.

The least possible penalty for plagiarism or cheating is a -100% on
the assignment (that's negative points, not just 0 credit). In places
where the cheating seems intentional, the penalty is an automatic F in
the course. TO BE CLEAR: you can get an automatic F in this course if
you are caught cheating on one small assignment, even one time.
