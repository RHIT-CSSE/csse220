# How to Clone the CSSE220 Repo

All the materials for CSSE220 are stored in [the course git
repo](https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse220.git).  To access code examples and homework, you must
use Eclipse to clone (that is, copy) the repo onto your machine

***

## Instructions

1. Start Eclipse
2. Go to *File > Import* in the menu
3. Select *Git > Projects From Git* from the folder list and click *Next* 
4. Select *Clone URI*
5. Type "https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse220.git" in the URI field and click *Next*
6. Make sure master is checked and click *Next*
7. You can choose any directory you like as your destination and click *Next*
   * You'll be able to use this directory to access a local copy of all the slides and other 220 materials, so pick a name that you will remember
8. Make sure the radio button selects *Import existing Eclipse projects* and click *Next*
   * It takes a bit of time for the repo to download to your machine

* The CSSE220 Repo has now been cloned and a copy resides on your machine

***

* At this point you can import an Eclipse project into Eclipse from the repo you just cloned

9. Click *Deselect all* 
   * Use the project search box at the top of the list of projects to search for the project you want to import
   * For example, type *JavaIntro* into the search box to find the JavaIntro Eclipse project
   * Check the box located in front of the desired homework (e.g., *JavaIntro*) and then click *Finish*

10. The Eclipse project you imported will show up in Eclipse's *Package Folder* pane
