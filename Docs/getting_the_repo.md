# How to Clone the CSSE220 Repo

All the materials for CSSE220 are stored in [the course git
repo](https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse220.git).  To access code examples and homework, you must
use Eclipse to clone (that is, copy) the repo onto your machine

8. Make sure the radio button selects *Import existing Eclipse projects* and click *Next*
   * It takes a bit of time for the repo to download to your machine
