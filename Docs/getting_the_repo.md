# How to Clone the CSSE220 Repo

All the materials for CSSE220 are stored in [the course git
repo](https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse220.git). To access starter code for in-class activities and homework, you must clone (that is, copy) the repo onto your machine. 

***

## Create a GitHub account associated with your Rose-Hulman email
1. Go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join). 
2. Create an account with the username `rhit-USERNAME`, where "USERNAME" is replaced with your Rose-Hulman username (the first part of your email address). For example, Prof. Ludden's would be rhit-luddenig. 

## Set up GitHub Desktop
3. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/). 
4. Launch GitHub Desktop and sign into your GitHub account. 

## Clone the CSSE220 repository
5. Select *File > Clone Repository...*, then copy/paste `https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse220.git` into the "Repository URL" field. 
6. Optionally adjust the "Local path" field. Note the local path. 
7. Click the "Clone" button. 
8. **(For Dr. Ludden's sections only)** In the top middle of GitHub Desktop, select the dropdown that says "Current branch: master" and select the `sig-2025` branch. 

## Check your local copy
9. Open your local copy of the csse220 repo by opening Windows Explorer (shortcut: `Win+E`) and navigating to the local path you saved in step 6. (If you forgot, check `C:\Users\USERNAME\OneDrive - Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\Documents\GitHub\csse220`, replacing `USERNAME` with yours.)
10. Verify that `csse220/Docs/getting_the_repo.md` matches this document. If so, you have successfully cloned the repo. If not, ask your instructor, a TA, or a classmate for help.
