# Submitting Code

## How to submit your code

We use GradeScope for all assignment submissions.  You need to
find your source files on your harddrive, and submit those files via
the GradeScope assignment as appropriate.  You can use the "Gradescope Access"
Link in the useful links and there is a link in the Moodle Homework section.

## How to find your source files

In IntelliJ, right click on the `src` directory in the "Project" tab
on the left side of the window.  Select "Open In > Explorer". 
A file explorer window should open. Enter the src directory. You should
see your files; upload them, or copy them someplace that's easier to
find.  Just don't delete/move them or your project will break! 

It is also possible to simply *drag and drop* your files from IntelliJ directly
to a website with a dropbox (such as GradeScope). 


## What files should I upload?

Upload all the .java files you've changed or added.  

* Don't upload files we provide but that you haven't edited (e.g., tests).
* Don't put your source files' Java packages (that is, subdirectories
  in the src directory), since that makes it more difficult for us to
  compile your code.
* Don't zip all your files together, since that makes things annoying for
  us.
* Don't include non-source files (e.g., .class files, .jar files).
* Don't try to use git or SVN to submit assignments.  Making a commit
  in your local git repo will not submit code to us.  Instead, just
  submit your updated files via GradeScope.
