[Video Walkthrough Setting Up Working Sets](https://rose-hulman.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3da761c9-7fac-43f6-85ae-afb9012179ff)

1. If you prefer to import all projects at once, or did so by accident, there is a way to set up "folders" for Eclipse projects
2. Make sure to select the Eclipse "Package Explorer View" NOT the "Project Explorer View"
3. To verify you have the correct view in Eclipse, Select Window->Show View->Package Explorer (If for some reason it is not an option select Windows->Show View->Other->Java->Package Explorer)
4. From the Package Explorer, click on the small icon with three vertical dots, then select Top Level Elements->Working Sets
5. After that, click the three vertical dot icon again and select "Configure Working Sets"
6. Create Working Sets for all the major categories of projects we will have in CSSE220:
 * PracticeSolutions (move all items that start with PracticeSolution here)
 * Practice (move all items that start with Practice but NOT PracticeSolution here)
 * Homework (move all items that start with HW here)
 * SampleExam (move all items that start with SampleExam here)
 * Current (we will use this to select the current proejcts for the day we will use)
 * Completed (we will move completed project here to remove the clutter of too many projects )
7. As described above you can move all the projects into these folders
8. As you work on Practice project (in-class exercises) you can move them to Current
9. As you complete Practice projects (in-class exercises) you can move them to Completed
10. Any projects you import such as Exams will be imported in the "Other" working set by default
